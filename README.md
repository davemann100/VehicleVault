# VehicleVault

I developed this Full-Stack application for the purpose of maintaining vehicle service records. It is a platform to manage all vehicle related expenses and inform users of their spending habits. Technologies used include HTML/CSS/Bootstrap front-end, Python back-end and SQL database.
